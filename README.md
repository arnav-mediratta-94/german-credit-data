# german-credit-data
As part of my data mining class, we were tasked with analyzing the file German Credit.xls and perform exploratory data analysis on the file. 
After performing EDA, we were told to build decision trees using different sizes of training and test samples and observe the difference made by each of the samples. This also involved testing on trees without pruning and trees with pruning. Once the decision models were build we were asked to implement misclassification costs into the algorithm and reduce the false positive rates that were being predicted.
